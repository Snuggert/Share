/* This skeleton code is provided for the practical work for the "BS"
   course 2012-2013 at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. It is untested code that
   shows how a command line could possibly be parsed by a very simple
   shell.

   At least one problem is known: a command string containg the (illegal)
   combination '||' will lead to severe problems - so add extra tests.

       the shell should call pipe(),

       its output to the pipe, and what program it should execute with
       what parameters.
       The code for the child should then do this.
       R:   the parent should then close the writing side of the pipe
       parse the remainder of the command string. 
       If there is another '|', it should once again call pipe()
       and fork again, letting the second child know
       a) to connect its input to the first pipe
       b) if applicable, to connect its output to the second pipe
       c) what program it should execute and with which parameters
       The code for the child should effectuate this
       If this was the final child in the chain, the parent returns, 
       otherwise it jumps back to R:
       N.B. The parent shell should never connect input or output to a pipe,
       such connection should only be made after a fork.
       N.B.2 The above recipe will result in a process tree where all
       programs on the command line are executed by direct descendants of
       the parent shell. For one, this makes it easier to check if all
       such programs have completed before waking up the shell again.
       N.B.3 It may be useful to create a record of the child processes created
       and their IDs
       N.B.4 Remember to undo the effect of sigaction in the child processes -
       it must be possible to terminate such processes by pressing ^C
